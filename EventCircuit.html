                    <h3 class="nopad">What is it?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">The Just Roll With It! NC Circuit is a Circuit similar to the 2GGT series in that players go to the listed tournaments in the circuit to get points. At the end of the circuit, the top 23 players + the winner of the Arcadian will be invited to the Finale to play for various prizes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="nopad">When/Where is it?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">The Circuit will begin with Just Roll With It! 11 on June 15th, being the first scored event. It will end in February. Tournaments will be occuring all across North Carolina, from Boone to Wilmington, Raleigh, to Charlotte.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="nopad">How do I participate?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">If you are a member of the NC Community or identify as an NC player (such as Blazerike, DIRq, Donquavious, Luckywind, Toast), then you are eligible to compete in the circuit! If you are not NC, then you can still go to circuit events, you just wont accumulate any points and will not have a chance to be invited to the finale.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="nopad">I'm a TO and I want my tournament in the circuit.</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">If you would like for your tournament to be a part of the circuit, please contact me. That can be done through Facebook Messenger (https://www.facebook.com/iKammikins), Twitter DM's (@Kam4ran), Discord (Kam Steele#9534), or email (ksmcclan@gmail.com).
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="nopad">How are events scored?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">Events are scored based on the amount of entrants the event gets. There are various ratings for tournaments ranging from E to SS. To see how many entrants each rating needs, and how many points you get at each placement, refer to the sheet labeled "Scoring System" in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dLtZvXU73lyStakpZGHFQs1cR0WRQ0PelemQWQ9IEJk/edit#gid=667186">this spreadsheet.</a>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="nopad">How does the Arcadian work?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">Like a typical Arcadian, if you are or have been Power Ranked, then you will not be eligible to enter the Arcadian. That means, if you aren't top 23 by the time the Arcadian rolls around, you will NOT be able to use the Arcadian as a "Last Chance Qualifier" to get in to the Finale. If you are already in the top 23, and you win the Arcadian, then the 24th player will be invited to the Finale (this also applies to people who can't show. E.g. if 6th and 11th can't attend, then 24th and 25th would be invited). The Arcadian will be the LAST event of the circuit before the finale.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="nopad">What are the Details of the Finale?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">The Finale will occur once covid-19 measures are in place and after all the Players have been invited. On top of the Finale where the top 24 will compete in Singles and Doubles, there will also be a normal tournament for those who didn't qualify. Finalists will not be required to pay an entry fee for the Finale Tournament. For Doubles, Finalists will pair up with eachother. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="nopad">What is the prize?</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p class="nopad">Every player who qualifies for the finals will recieve cash payout. While those who place last will not recieve much, the winner of the Circuit Finale will have an all expenses paid trip (Flight, Entry, Hotel, Food Stipend) to MomoCon 2020. There will also be non-cash prizes for other placements. The prize for the regular tournament will be standard and based on the # of entrants.
                        </p>
