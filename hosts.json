		"first": "Kamaran McClanahan started the series off as a passion project with a friend that also had a mutual interest in tournaments in early 2016. Both organizers met while studying at North Carolina State University, playing together in their free time. Kamaran decided to stick with the tournament organizing, eventually turning the series into a large passion that required a larger team to work with.",
		"second": "Throughout the lifespan of the tournament, there have been multiple other hosts to the tournament series alongside Kamaran. Thomas Moore was the first to sign onto the team, helping since the second installment of the series. After leaving NC State, Thomas would still help run the tournaments when possible but couldn't make every event.",
		"third": "Other hosts like Tony DiVincenzo, Robert Dote, Landon Tepedino, and other friends of Kamaran have all had a part in helping with the series. These individuals are all organizers of their own, brought on as trusted team members in an attempt to create a close-knit team to make the events as successful as possible."
